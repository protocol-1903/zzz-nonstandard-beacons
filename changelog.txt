Version: 1.3.0
Date: 2025-07-13
  Features:
    - Added a custom variation of the electric beacon to use new features (energy_source.type = "electric-2-electric-boogaloo") thanks for the name @Osmo
    - Added the ability for beacons to use effect_reciever.uses_module_effects, which means the beacon will have it's source effected by the modules it's using.
    - Added quality verification such that quality enabled nonstandard beacons match up their beacon supposed stats to their source stats, if uses_module_effects is enabled
    - Added automatic migrations whenever mods change to check if any of the nonstandard beacons should be updated
    - Added a command "update_beacons" to update beacons, used for mod development and fixing critical issues. Use -help ingame for a complete description
    - Added validation to automatic migrations to check if any entities have been removed or invalidated on mod change
    - Added a required dependency on module inserter
  Changes:
    - Removed the allowed_effects custom field because it overrode the existing field under the same name and did literally nothing
    - The mod will error if uses_module_effects and uses_beacon_effects are both true, only one can be used at a time for now due to implementation restrictions
    - Event filters are generated during the prototype stage, vastly speeding up the load time of saves with no impact on game load speed
    - Bumped minimum Factorio version to 2.0.58 to use ModDataPrototype
